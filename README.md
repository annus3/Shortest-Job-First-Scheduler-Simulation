# Shortest Job First Scheduler Simulation

This program simulates the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm in C.

## Overview

The SJF algorithm is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. This program demonstrates the scheduling of processes based on their burst times using the SJF approach.

## Features

- Accepts user input for the number of processes and their burst times.
- Sorts the processes based on their burst times.
- Calculates waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- Displays the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortest-job-first.git
